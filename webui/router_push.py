"""UniFi Network app (local controller) API client for pushing a generated
WireGuard config to a Dream Router's native VPN Client feature.

Both the auth flow (login) and the add-VPN-client call are confirmed
against a real Dream Router running UniFi OS, via two real HAR captures
(see HANDOFF.md). Neither matched the earlier reverse-engineered
github.com/tmcpro/unifi-network-api spec this was first based on:

- Login is POST /api/auth/login (not /api/login), needs a priming GET
  first (see login()'s docstring), and can require a second request with
  an MFA code for an SSO-linked account.
- Adding a WireGuard client is POST .../api/s/{site}/rest/networkconf --
  note this is the *older* REST-collection API style
  (/proxy/network/api/s/{site}/rest/{collection}), not the v2 API style
  seen for login and for listing VPN users (/proxy/network/v2/api/site/
  {site}/...). UniFi's Network app apparently mixes both per feature.
  The captured payload is refreshingly simple: the entire generated
  .conf text goes verbatim into wireguard_client_configuration_file --
  no need to parse out individual WireGuard fields.
